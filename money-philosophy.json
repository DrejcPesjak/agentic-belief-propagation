    "I save aggressively because having a safety buffer is the fastest way to feel free and make better decisions.",
    "I spend on experiences and people now because life is short and money is pointless if you never use it.",
    "I invest early and consistently because long-term compounding matters more than trying to time the market.",
    "I avoid all debt because owing money adds stress and it's too easy to lose control.",
    "I'm fine using debt strategically, like for a home or education, as long as the interest is reasonable and I can repay it safely.",
    "I prioritize high income even if it's stressful, because earning more gives you options and you can dial back later.",
    "I prioritize a simpler life with lower income because time, health, and calm are worth more than extra money."
